        "\n",
        "This is the **most efficient approach** for collecting training data!\n",
        "\n",
        "## How It Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Phase 1: Build Cost Pool (~7.5 hours)\n",
        "1. Generate 300 random cost sets\n",
        "2. Optimize each once\n",
        "3. Store all (costs, features) pairs\n",
        "\n",
        "### Phase 2: Match Preferences (~instant)\n",
        "1. Generate random preferences\n",
        "2. Score all 300 solutions against preferences\n",
        "3. Pick best match\n",
        "4. Save (preference, best_costs, best_features)\n",
        "5. Repeat to create 400+ training samples!\n",
        "\n",
        "## Benefits:\n",
        "- ✅ **400+ training samples from 300 optimizations**\n",
        "- ✅ **Much faster**: ~7.5 hours (vs 20 hours for 200 samples)\n",
        "- ✅ **Better diversity**: All preferences see all costs\n",
        "- ✅ **Reusable**: Can generate more samples anytime\n",
        "- ✅ **Fallback**: Generates custom costs for poor matches"
