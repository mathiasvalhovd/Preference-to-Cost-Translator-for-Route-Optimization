    "## Two-Phase Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 1: Build Cost Pool\n",
    "- Generate random cost parameters\n",
    "- Optimize each with ODL API\n",
    "- Store (costs, features) pairs\n",
    "- Can skip if you already have cost_pool.json\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2: Match Preferences (New!)\n",
    "- Generate random preferences\n",
    "- Get **top 30 solutions** from pool (closest to ideal)\n",
    "- Use **Pareto evaluation** to select best\n",
    "- Save training samples\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits:\n",
    "- ✅ 30 unique outputs (vs 5-7 with old method)\n",
    "- ✅ High quality (top 15% of solutions)\n",
    "- ✅ No arbitrary scaling factors\n",
    "- ✅ Ready for regression training"

    "## 🎯 Strategic Diverse Sampling (V6 Update)\n",
    "\n",
    "**New in V6:** The pipeline now uses **strategic diverse sampling** instead of pure random sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why?\n",
    "- Pure random sampling → Small Pareto front (7-10 solutions)\n",
    "- Strategic sampling → Larger Pareto front (20-40 solutions)\n",
    "- Better training data diversity for regression\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works:\n",
    "The `sample_diverse_costs()` method randomly chooses one of 5 strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Time-focused** (20%): High time costs → Fast routes preferred\n",
    "2. **Distance-focused** (20%): High distance costs → Short routes preferred  \n",
    "3. **Parking-focused** (20%): High parking costs → Easy parking preferred\n",
    "4. **Balanced** (20%): Moderate costs → Balanced solutions\n",
    "5. **Random** (20%): Wide ranges → Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures your cost pool covers the entire feature space, not just one corner!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended pool sizes:\n",
    "- **Quick test**: 100 samples (~1 hour) → Expect 15-25 Pareto solutions\n",
    "- **Standard**: 200 samples (~2 hours) → Expect 25-40 Pareto solutions\n",
    "- **Comprehensive**: 300 samples (~3 hours) → Expect 35-50 Pareto solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** With diverse sampling, 200-300 samples is usually sufficient. More samples won't significantly increase Pareto front size."
